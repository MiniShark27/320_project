            description="With food safety concerns over the alarming increase in food poisoning cases attributed to food eaten outside of the home, it is essential that every caterer takes steps to ensure that all food-handling staff are supervised and/or trained in food hygiene matters. Failure to comply with regulations can result in prosecution and lead to a substantial fine or, in extreme cases, imprisonment. Bad publicity can also ruin a food business, often affecting people’s livelihoods, but, ultimately, food poisoning can kill. Therefore, effective staff training and supervision is of paramount importance, especially in an industry with such a high staff turnover of semi-skilled and unskilled kitchen staff. Legislation regarding training encompasses food safety and hygiene, but you must not forget to make sure your staff are also aware of other issues. For example the use and storage guidelines for your cooking and refrigeration equipment - as storing and displaying food at too high a temperature is one of the most common causes of food poisoning."
